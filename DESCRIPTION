Version: 0.1.0.1
Authors@R: person("Akhil", "Name", email = "yup.im.aki@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The main purpose of this package is to provide a single function to update table in a MySQL database by key.
  To achieve this, there first must be a method to create a keyed MySQL table available. This set up naturally lends itself to data.table where tables can be keyed natively
  The update is achieved via a DELETE + INSERT. The INSERT uses the standard RMySQL function. The delete could be improved as this is just string parsing.
